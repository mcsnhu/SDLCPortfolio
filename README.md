How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

User needs can be analyzed and synthesized into more concrete directions for our program via the creation of user stories, which are essentially short stories or descriptions of needs with the goal of simply encapsulating what actual users want and informing the developers what exactly they should change. Getting feedback via focus groups or interviews is essential for a well rounded agile development process.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

With transparency; I want to make sure that every member of my team knows what every other member is doing, what they should be doing, and when said things should be done by so that everyone has a solid grasp on the direction of the project. Daily meetings and retrospectives are good ways to foster this level of transparency.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

To be a team member that is clear about what they have done, what they will do, and what issues they might have. The first two keep the rest of the team in the know while the last is essential as it allows team leaders to clear these issues and keep everyone working efficiently.
